## 🤖 What is WalkLLM?

**WalkLLM** is an experimental framework that connects **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** and **LLMs** by using **random walks** to drive context-aware prompting and semantic exploration.

Each step in the walk guides the language model to generate or query new information, effectively simulating a conversational traversal of a structured space.

## 🧠 Key Features

* 🔁 Perform random walks over any RDF-style or NetworkX-style graph
* 💬 Use walk paths to construct evolving prompts for LLMs
* 🧩 Mix deterministic queries with generative text
* 🕸 Semantic drift control via walk temperature and history
* ⚙️ Pluggable backends for LLM inference (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mircus/WalkGPT.git
cd WalkGPT
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run a walk + prompt loop

```bash
python walkgpt.py --config config.json
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A **graph** is loaded (e.g. social graph, ontology, KG)
2. A **random walk** selects a sequence of nodes/edges
3. A **prompt template** integrates this walk as context
4. An **LLM** generates or completes based on the prompt
5. The output can be used to guide further walks or exploration

> This creates a loop between symbolic structure and linguistic creativity.
